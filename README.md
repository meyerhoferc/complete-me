#Complete-Me
##Description
Complete-Me poses the challenge of creating a simple text based auto complete. The backbone of Complete-Me is a "trie" tree, short for a re-trie-val tree. The "tree" is used for storing and fetching paths that map out possible words. Complete-Me is a broadly-branched tree where paths from the root to the leaves represent “words” within the dictionary.
##Required Features
  * Insert a single word to the autocomplete dictionary
  * Count the number of words in the dictionary
  * Populate a newline-separated list of words into the dictionary
  * Suggest completions for a substring
  * Mark a selection for a substring
  * Weight subsequent suggestions based on previous selections
